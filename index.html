										<p class="tab1"> As a soon to be graduate from the University of Saint Thomas, I am majoring in Computer Science with a double minor in Applied Statistics and Communications. I am currently seeking a career aligned with the computer science field. I am passionate about web development, database design, and info security.
											At my previous internship at Final Stretch, I was responsible
											for creating social media advertisements, editing websites, communicating with customers, and managing email campaigns. Please see my resume to learn more about my skills and projects!

											<h3 class="tab1">Problem Solver:</h3>
											
											<p class="tab1">  Through my studies, I have successfully completed 30+ projects across a myriad of platforms and using many languages including Java, C, Python, SQL, HTML, Assembly, Machine, JavaScript, and R. 
												All of which required intense problem-solving skills. When I created my own database schema, I was met with many challenges. It was important that all data could be accessed and no repetition would occur.  
												Using creativity and innovation, I was able to overcome these obstacles by using Third Normal Form and received top marks on my design. My previous internship also demanded problem-solving abilities. 
												When a customer came with a complaint, it was my duty to solve their issue and leave them with a positive experience.
												</p>

					
													<h3 class="tab1"> &nbsp Skilled Communicator:</h3>
												
												<p class="tab1">Previously, as a Marketing and Communications Intern at Final Stretch INC, I  effectively communicated with 2000+ customers throughout my career there. 
													I coordinated with the manager and co-workers to schedule calls, email campaigns, and advertising release dates. 
													I also minored in communications, taking 6 courses requiring speeches, presentations, and collaboration. 
													These capabilities will be a benefit to this position.
